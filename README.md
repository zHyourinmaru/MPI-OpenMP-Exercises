Four algorithms in C, parallel or distributed, in a Linux environment, using OpenMP and MPI.


Maxsum: the algorithm calculates the sum of the elements of a row of a matrix, finding the maximum among the sums of the rows. Shared memory.

Laplace: laplace algorithm computation in distributed environment.

Matmatthread: row-by-column product computation between matrices, which can use the spatial locality of the matrix to improve performance. Shared memory.

Matmatdist: added to matmatthread, applying SUMMA algorithm, in distributed environment.
